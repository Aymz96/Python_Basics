# Boolean and Comparision Operators.

# boolean is a data type that is either true or false

print(True)
print(False)

print(type(True))
print(type(False))

# Comparison Operators
# Comparison Operators allow us sto evaluate a code, they output --> 'bool'
num_a = 10
num_b = 13

## asserting if something is equal
## use double equal to equate to something
print(10 == "10")

print(num_a == 10)
print(num_b == 23)

# Greater than
print('using .')
print(num_a > 10)
print(num_b > 13)

# Less than
print('using .')
print(num_a < 10)
print(num_b < 10)
# greater than or equal to

# less than or equal to

# Not equal
print('!= not equal')
print(10 != 1)

# Is (of something)
print(0 is 0)
